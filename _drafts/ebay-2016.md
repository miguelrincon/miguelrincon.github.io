### Response to state of JavaScript in 2017

When I worked in the Pulsar team in ebay in 2016, life (as a front-end developer) was good. 

They had been working in the UI for their project for about a year, with a few mixed results. The team was not happy with the progress using AngularJS. The backend team was putting forward features faster than the UI add to their product, and they hired me a JavaScript developer to join they team.

This was my first project in AngularJS. Like when I decided to learn BackboneJS, I went through one of the most popular AngularJS books and started the process of working on their UI. I proposed a rather different way of setting up (using UI Router for most of what later I would come to know as “state management”), and the development speed ramped up.

I had learned a lot about AngularJS this way. AngularJS worked well. Our colleagues were impressed with the result and I had made my mark as Front-end developer in the team. Of course, I am working with JavaScript, things had to change.
