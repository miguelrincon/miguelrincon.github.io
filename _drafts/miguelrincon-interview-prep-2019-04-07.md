# Written Questions

## Q1. What is the benefit of using a library like React/Vue/Angular vs using plain old JavaScript? What is your experience level with one of those frameworks?

Software libraries are sets of tools that solve a typical problems in software development. Libraries like React/Vue/Angular solve problems typical in web and single page applications.

These libraries help teams of developers do two things that are difficult to do with plain old JavaScript. First, group the functionality of their applications in components which extend HTML, so the applications we build can grow in complexity while staying manageable; and second, organize their logic in an opinionated way, so other developers that want to contribute to their project can easily understand how to contribute.

I have worked heavily in AngularJS to build applications for eBay and [Volkswagen Finance](https://www.vwfs-online.com/), and later moved to lead teams that were using Vue with Cordova. More recently, I used WeChat's mini-app framework to create applications for Porsche Club, a branch of Porsche China.

## Q2. When is CORS needed and how does it work in the browser?

(Is hard for website servers to keep track of sessions of their users due to the stateless design of HTTP. For this reason, browsers keep track of the state via cookies and send session information in headers to the server on every HTTP request.)

Information contained in HTTP request headers is used by servers to identify user sessions privately, so the browser must ensure that all requests sent to a server are from the same website as the server it is in, this is a policy called "Same origin policy". This is especially important since websites can issue AJAX requests to any destination and not directly triggered by the user.

CORS (Cross-domain resource sharing) is a way for browsers to allow websites to get around this Same origin policy and load data from other sites. The web server being called can respond with a special header ("Access-Control-Allow-Origin") to indicate to the browser that it should permit requests to be shared to from websites in other domain (or origin).

## Q3. What is an XSS attack? Explain what can lead to one and how can it be vented?

A website may display information generated by users, such as a simple comment on a textbox. Websites must be careful of rendering user-provided data, which could be interpreted by the browser as HTML that can deform their site.

As in my previous "comment textbox" example, an XSS attack occurs if a malicious user inputs text with the aim of having their comment rendered as a `<script>` tag, and having the code in the script tag change the way in which the site should behave (such as send private information to other servers).

To prevent XSS attacks the input of the users must be "sanitized", so it cannot contain any `script` tags, or so that the `script` tags are rendered in a non-harmful way.

There are two moments when sanitization of users' input can occur, either before the user input is stored or when the data is rendered as HTML output. 

## Q4. Tell us about your latest "hard to debug" problem. How did you resolve it? Which tools did you use?

Recently I faced an apparently random issue in one of our projects: some requests to our API would return a 500 error at apparently random moments. Users were seeing the issue infrequently, but it affected the homepage. There was pattern: the issue was present in two requests, one, which loaded some promotional data and other that, would show the users newsfeed: both requests were issued from the homepage. 

After some digging, I found that it was a database locking issue. I used the apache logs to diagnose the issue and `curl` to reproduce it by making two requests in quick succession.

Since we had implemented a gamification feature recently, the first users’ homepage request would write to the points table and the second read from it at almost the same time. We patched the issue by locking the points related transactions correctly. 

## Q5. Tell us about your most advanced/exciting/mind-blowing JS/CSS implementation

I am very proud of my work at eBay. While there, I worked on a project called Pulsar UI. It is similar to Google Analytics: it can show data for users to understand the traffic on eBay's multiple sites.

When I joined the team to work on their UI, and AngularJS application. The UI team had a lot of trouble handling the state of the application. They had created a lot "spaghetti" code to keep track of what the user had done and what page should be displayed. It all came crashing down when a feature for "bookmarking" was needed and it was obvious it was impossible to implement. 

I created a demo in which I restructured the project around [UI Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) and rebuilt much of the UI in a few weeks. Now, it was possible to add new pages (reports) easily and we even got to build a point and click dashboard creator.

This was exciting because I was able to help the team with their biggest bottleneck: the front-end, and the patterns I designed allowed for other team members to create new functionality in a few simple steps. Pulsar UI went from a callback mess, to become a dashboard framework with reusable components and views.

Unfortunately eBay moved on for that project, but it is still around in the original [Github repository](https://github.com/pulsarIO/pulsar-reporting-ui) and published on my site [as a fork](https://miguelrincon.github.io/pages/pulsar-reporting-ui/).

#### STAR questions

1. **Tell me about a time you had a conflict at work.** STAR Model Answer: There was a disagreement I had with a coworker which originated from a miscommunication. To keep our work environment professional and positive, we had to discuss it and make amends. I sat down with them one day during lunch, paid for their meal, and took initiative by apologizing for my part in the whole mess. Now, we work together well and are often praised for our impressive teamwork.

2. **Can you describe a stressful situation and how you handled it?** STAR Model Answer: At my last restaurant, I once found out mere hours in advance about a health inspection. As the head chef, I was in charge of making sure everything was in order in the kitchen and the BOH before the inspector arrived. I quickly called in employees from the last shift to help out, leaving the others available to prep for that evening’s dinner. As a result, we were able to ace the inspection, less costly in the long run compared to giving employees a few hours of overtime.

3. **Can you detail a mistake you made and how you reacted to it?** STAR Model Answer: One time, I switched the packing labels of two packages I sent to customers. I had to correct the problem without angering the clients. I called them both up and provided them with shipping labels with the correct addresses while offering each of them a small gift certificate to use on a future order. The customers not only helped me fix my mistake, but they were both satisfied and will return and shop again.

4. **Tell me about a time when you performed well under enormous pressure.** STAR Model Answer: At my last job, my coworker needed to miss work for some time, and their project was left unfinished and without a manager. My supervisor instructed me to take on the project, and with no leniency on the deadline, I had days to complete a project that originally should have taken several weeks. I requested and was granted reduced weekly goals, giving me more time to finish the special project. As far as my weekly goals, I was able to delegate them out to teammates. With my reduced goals, I dedicated more time to the special project. This allowed me to finish it on time and with complete accuracy. My supervisor appreciated my attitude and drive, and I was given several more projects after that, along with an eventual promotion and pay raise.

5. **Have you ever dealt with a sticky situation involving another department?** STAR Model Answer: Previously, my department had a misunderstanding with members of our accounting department. We needed to correct the issue to keep office morale from plummeting. I gave my team a small budget and instructed my team to each pick out a thoughtful present for their counterpart in accounting. Later that night and from then onward, we became friends and strong colleagues.

6. **Give me an example of a goal you met.** STAR Model Answer: Last October, I had to write six articles for the month to keep our blog fresh. I created an action plan for myself, with deadlines as to when each article should be published. I finished that month with six articles written and ahead of schedule.

7. **Give me an example of a goal you couldn't meet and how you handled it.** STAR Model Answer: Last November, I had to write six articles for the month to keep our blog fresh. Throughout the month, I was tasked with small responsibilities that took time away from my goal. I was unable to complete my six posts, but I talked to my supervisor and detailed all my extra work completed, and I was praised for my accomplishments, as well.

8. **Tell me about a time when you had to placate an unsatisfied client.** STAR Model Answer: As a flight attendant, I had a passenger who seemed to hate his seat next to a wailing infant. I decided to see what I could do to ease his suffering before he complained. With unoccupied seats in business class, I upgraded that passenger, and he was thrilled at his luck while the mother and infant were given more room to spread out.

9. **Have you ever had a disagreement with an immediate supervisor?** STAR Model Answer: I once disagreed with my supervisor on the wording of her instructions. As her employee, I had to balance my respect for her with my English lessons from school. Instead of shoving a dictionary in her face, I apologized for the confusion and told her that I saw where we became confused. She respected me much more after that, and she even gave her recommendation for my promotion.

10. **Describe a time when you went above and beyond.** STAR Model Answer: Earlier this year, there was a day where I had to come in to the garden center on a Saturday and take care of some tasks on which we were behind. I came in, listening to my headphones the entire time, and ended up finishing everything before lunch. As I was in such a productive mood, I stayed the full day, and eventually completed tasks that were meant for the following few days. Since that day, the garden center has never fallen behind again.

1. **Tell me about how you worked effectively under pressure.** I had been working on a key project that was scheduled for delivery to the client in 60 days. My supervisor came to me and said that we needed to speed it up and be ready in 45 days, while keeping our other projects on time. I made it into a challenge for my staff, and we effectively added just a few hours to each of our schedules and got the job done in 42 days by sharing the workload. Of course, I had a great group of people to work with, but I think that my effective allocation of tasks was a major component that contributed to the success of the project.

2. **How do you handle a challenge? Give an example.** One time, my supervisor needed to leave town unexpectedly, and we were in the middle of complicated negotiations with a new sponsor. I was tasked with putting together a PowerPoint presentation just from the notes he had left, and some briefing from his manager. My presentation turned out successfully - we got the sponsorship, and the management team recommended me for an award. 

3. **Have you ever made a mistake? How did you handle it?** One time I misquoted the fees for a particular type of membership to the club where I worked. I explained my mistake to my supervisor, who appreciated my coming to him, and my honesty. He told me to offer to waive the application fee for the new member. The member joined the club despite my mistake, my supervisor was understanding, and although I felt bad that I had made a mistake, I learned to pay close attention to the details so as to be sure to give accurate information in the future.

4. **Give an example of how you set goals.** Within a few weeks of beginning my first job as a sales associate in a department store, I knew that I wanted to be in the fashion industry. I decided that I would work my way up to department manager, and at that point I would have enough money saved to be able to attend design school full-time. I did just that, and I even landed my first job through an internship I completed the summer before graduation.

5. **Give an example of a goal you reached and tell me how you achieved it.** When I started working for XYZ Company, I wanted to achieve the Employee of the Month title. It was a motivational challenge, and not all the employees took it that seriously, but I really wanted that parking spot, and my picture on the wall. I went out of my way to be helpful to my colleagues, supervisors, and customers - which I would have done anyway. I liked the job and the people I worked with. The third month I was there, I got the honor. It was good to achieve my goal, and I actually ended up moving into a managerial position there pretty quickly, I think because of my positive attitude and perseverance.

6. **Describe a decision you made that wasn't popular and how you handled implementing it.** Once, I inherited a group of employees when their supervisor relocated to another city. They had been allowed to cover each other’s shifts without management approval. I didn’t like the inconsistencies, where certain people were being given more opportunities than others. I introduced a policy where I had my assistant approve all staffing changes, to make sure that everyone who wanted extra hours and was available at certain times could be utilized.

7. **Give an example of how you worked on a team.** During my last semester in college, I worked as part of a research team in the History department. The professor leading the project was writing a book on the development of language in Europe in the Middle Ages. We were each assigned different sectors to focus on, and I suggested that we meet independently before our weekly meeting with the professor to discuss our progress, and help each other out if we were having any difficulties. The professor really appreciated the way we worked together, and it helped to streamline his research as well. He was ready to start on his final copy months ahead of schedule because of the work we helped him with.

8. **What do you do if you disagree with someone at work?** A few years ago, I had a supervisor who wanted me to find ways to outsource most of the work we were doing in my department. I felt that my department was one where having the staff on premises had a huge impact on our effectiveness and ability to relate to our clients. I presented a strong case to her, and she came up with a compromise plan.

9. **Share an example of how you were able to motivate employees or co-workers.** I was in a situation once where the management of our department was taken over by employees with experience in a totally different industry, in an effort to maximize profits over service. Many of my co-workers were resistant to the sweeping changes that were being made, but I immediately recognized some of the benefits, and was able to motivate my colleagues to give the new process a chance to succeed. 

10. **Have you handled a difficult situation? How?** When I worked at ABC Global, it came to my attention that one of my employees had become addicted to painkillers prescribed after she had surgery. Her performance was being negatively impacted, and she needed to get some help. I spoke with her privately, and I helped her to arrange a weekend treatment program that was covered by her insurance. Fortunately, she was able to get her life back on track, and she received a promotion about six months later.

### What is your current location and do you have any plans to relocate? (relevant in context of compensation, country-hiring guidelines, and in case an offer would be made)

- I am currently located in Shanghai, and I am have mid terms plans to relocate. In fact, I am looking for positions open in Amsterdam.

### Do you require visa sponsorship or a work permit to work for GitLab?

- I must probably do, however if the company doesn't have a legal entity here, it is possible for another company to hire as a third party. Additionally, in a few months I should be able to stay in China under a spouse visa.
- It depends on my setup, and I can do the research needed for this.

### What is the notice period you would need if you were hired?

- 1 month minimum according to my contract. As far as I know, doing the procedures could take about 1-2  additional weeks.

### What are your compensation expectations?

- Frontend Engineer | Intermediate | Amsterdam | $67,096 - $70,383 (58,631 EUR - 61,503 EUR)
- Frontend Engineer | Intermediate | China | $44,100 - $46,261 (303,342 CNY - 318,206 CNY)
