# Can we be technolgicly agnostic?

How can one team really work on a technologically agnostic solutions if we express our ideas through code, is like asking an organization to be language-agnostic and work in any language, always we will need to choose a common ground, languages will become a requirement accross different regions, poeple can learn a new leanguage and then they can switch teams...

When tasked with an  IT landscape we find many project left by different teams...? the only constant is that things don't fit each other

Google can somehow be technologically agnostic... but still most of the engineers are hired in what?

Containers, virtualization, etc.. break the barriers that once where setup by plaftforms and language, so our IT landscape can share more, micrsoervices topics help shape the solutions in many language accross different teams, but companies still might benefit from having a single standard solution and then deviate for very specific domain issues like using R to create data driven solutions.
