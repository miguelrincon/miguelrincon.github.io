### Response to state of JavaScript in 2017

When I worked in the Pulsar team in ebay in 2016, life (as a front-end developer) was good. 

They had been working in the UI for their project for about a year, with mixed few results. The team was not happy with the progress using AngularJS. The backend team was putting forward features faster than the UI add to their product, and they hired me a JavaScript developer to join they team.

This was my first project in AngularJS, I was probably later than others, I took a few weeks to study the framework, got the book, and started the process of working on their UI. I proposed a rather different way of setting up their pages (using UI Router), and the development speed ramped up dramatically.

I had learned a lot and I had got it. AngularJS was awesome, colleagues were impressed with the result and I had made my mark as Front-end developer. And then it was all different.

#### The new frameworks

While I was working on an AngularJS project I was proud of, busy, focused and uninterrupted. Out there in the world, the battle for positioning the next best JS framework was on. React, Vue and Angular 2 were battling for the minds of developers... and I had missed it all. I didn't keep up with those news.

Very soon the tools and frameworks that I was using became very quickly outdated and even forgotten.

React is bazaar and Angular is catedral, you can discuss for ages about which one is better, and you would get nowhwere. Bazaar's are noisier and that may have an effect on the amount of news we hear about React compared to other frameworks.

#### The fatigue

As I moved to another project and team, I realized how outdated I had become, how, for example, mobile development, had moved much beyond responsive designs. If faced with a choice, I had to move to another framework, and there was no clear winner.

Learning JavaScript became a chore for me. It started ...

I was not able to articulate this feeling very clearly initially but then I found this:

Our bosses don't care what framework we are using, that is good and that is bad. Is good because we have the freedom to choose our tools and is bad because they will see little reason to invest in the next big thing. This makes things difficult when you want to justify going for a new framework.

In any case don't rewrite becuase hen you will end up with more bugs and more delays. Do find which new project or spin off can be beetter. Rewirte only small parts of the code, learn the pholsopphy of the new tools and follow it it in the old tools. 

State management is something that should be in the back of any developers mind when coding their applications. The state can be stored only I an few defined places, such as the URL, that was one of the big insights of UI router, and it continues to speak to me. Later Redux seems to be the way in case you want to really go for power.

### The state of JS in 2017

I am optimizitic and very interested in learning more about the new frameworks. I seem to feel a lack of philosoy in the frameworks, beyond the what is cool and what is not.

More than anything, I would like to have stabillity come out of the community. Our bosses, businesses, don't need a new JavaScript framework, they are looking for ways to make their development better and faster, for them speed is everything. For example, Google's UI is not being changed by the new framework, the stick with Closure. The will keep it until they don't see a way to go faster with what they already have.

"The JavaScript world is richer and messier than ever."

So true.
