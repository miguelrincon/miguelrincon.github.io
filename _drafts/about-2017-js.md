2018 is starting and I am excited about what the JavaScript ecosystem will be for developers. I am mostly excited because it this ecosystem, the feedback loop is closing, and both library authors and developers want and expect more stablility.

#### 2016 had those new frameworks

In 2016 I worked only using AngularJS and I was proud of the fact that projects using it were very successful and got results very fast. 

At the same time, JS frameworks were competing to replace it. There were concerns about the scalability of AngularJS: it was hard to grow an AngularJS app to enterprise level for large teams. AngularJS was not designed with high performance in mind, which crippled its usage on mobiles. 

React, Vue and Angular 2 were battling for the minds of developers as well as many other accompanying tools, to build their apps. In 2016, this “Cambrian explosion” of JS libraries and tools made many of the tools I used, actually, outdated.

Particularly React and Angular 2, or simply Angular, worked with very different models. React, with its rich ecosystem of plugins was a big bazaar of ideas and approaches, while Angular, with a “batteries included“ approach became a cathedral. Each approach presented would shape any UI project very differently.

Certainly, React still has a more vocal community, 

#### The fatigue

Competition is very good, JavaScript developers are more critical than most when it comes to choosing their tooling, they are more thorough than others. made developers a lot more critical of their choice 


As I moved to another project and team, I realized how outdated I had become, how, for example, mobile development, had moved much beyond responsive designs. If faced with a choice, I had to move to another framework, and there was no clear winner.

Learning JavaScript became a chore for me. It started ...

I was not able to articulate this feeling very clearly initially but then I found this:

Our bosses don't care what framework we are using, that is good and that is bad. Is good because we have the freedom to choose our tools and is bad because they will see little reason to invest in the next big thing. This makes things difficult when you want to justify going for a new framework.

In any case don't rewrite becuase hen you will end up with more bugs and more delays. Do find which new project or spin off can be beetter. Rewirte only small parts of the code, learn the pholsopphy of the new tools and follow it it in the old tools. 

State management is something that should be in the back of any developers mind when coding their applications. The state can be stored only I an few defined places, such as the URL, that was one of the big insights of UI router, and it continues to speak to me. Later Redux seems to be the way in case you want to really go for power.

### The state of JS in 2017

I am optimizitic and very interested in learning more about the new frameworks. I seem to feel a lack of philosoy in the frameworks, beyond the what is cool and what is not.

More than anything, I would like to have stabillity come out of the community. Our bosses, businesses, don't need a new JavaScript framework, they are looking for ways to make their development better and faster, for them speed is everything. For example, Google's UI is not being changed by the new framework, the stick with Closure. The will keep it until they don't see a way to go faster with what they already have.

"The JavaScript world is richer and messier than ever."

So true.
