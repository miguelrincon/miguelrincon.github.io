I lead a small development team, and while a big part of my job relates to software and it technical aspects, most of my duty requires that I attend meetings, make presentations, or run occasional financial analysis of the projects I work on.

## My inner geek felt abandoned!

As an engineer that has spent quite a few years in the industry, I started to feel my technical skills were not growing (or even declining!) due to lack of practice and study. In my team leader job I simply cannot specialize too much in the “details” (unless things really break, when details really matter!).

My technical skills are still a big part of my contribution and are needed to have the right conversations during my work. While this or that skill may not apply directly, as a whole, I can perform better if I know the inside of what I am talking about. Life is learning.

## Where to learn? 

While a StackOverflow post, or a random Google search will answer a specific question, to really learn (or relearn) about a technology or approach I often prefer a more structured approach. I used to buy e-books, but when I did my research a few months ago I understood clearly that online options for self-learning are extremely abundant and of very high quality. 

The courses come with videos, auto-checking coding exercises and online command lines. Most courses are even gamified! (Getting some XP points after a session is an additional satisfying feeling).


## What to learn?

I reviewed many options and I settled on a few long form courses that help me review and relearn old topics, as well as new ones. I didn’t necessarily choose them to look for a different career path, but to keep my curiosity for learning alive and set some goals outside of work.

I didn’t go for short courses or articles, a bit opposed to my usual [breadth first learning](http://wiki.c2.com/?BreadthFirstLearning), because I think I will benefit for a deep dive at this point. I didn’t go for “free”, mainly because the paid couses offer a much higher quality and I can put some aside to [invest in myself](https://medium.com/swlh/take-the-time-to-invest-in-yourself-your-future-depends-on-it-650303a4c). One thing that I did not find much of, is courses aimed at engineers with more experience, often, they are aimed to beginners and newcomers. 

These are some of the courses which I have used or plan using:

### Udacity - Nandegree

They make a very strong case for newcomers, and they partner with the likes of Google and Amazon to create their materials.

I finally chose the “Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program”, because it allows me to review many of the skills I need day-to-day, it uses Python as their back-end programming language, which I have been looking forward to learn.

I am starting the Nanodegree program in a few weeks.

### AWS Certificates from Acloud Guru

In fact, this was the course that I used to obtain my AWS certification (link), and I strongly suggest it for anyone that wants to pass it without spending days in dense AWS documentation.

### DataCamp’s Data Scientist with Python Career Track

Although I am not sure I will specialize in data science in the short term, data is everywhere in the industry, plus, Data Science’s approach to problem solving is very refreshing for me.

I am currently doing the Python Career track, which consists of 23 courses and about 84 hours. I have yet to go to their “projects” section, which seems to provide a lot more hands on work, similar to a the daily work of data scientists.

### Udemy, perfect for small courses and skills

I have taken a few short courses in Udemy, and they are comprehensive for general topics. Often come with discounts to get any course for a few dollars.

### Finally, NodeJS master class

[![NodeJS master class](/img/posts/learning/nodejs-master-class.png)](https://pirple.thinkific.com/courses/the-nodejs-master-class)

They use a refreshing approach, which uses “No Frameworks, No NPM, No Dependencies” and apply it to an ecosystem that is so often overloaded with third party libraries. Reminiscent of [Learn Code the hard way](https://learncodethehardway.org/) approach.

I have to find time to do this one!

Keeping my inner geek alive and well has been fun, and I will continue to search for options and ideas to do it. After all even architects [should code](http://wiki.c2.com/?ArchitectsDontCode).
