Thanks to the great courses by ["A Cloud Guru"](https://acloud.guru/) (and a whole Spring Festival holiday of study I got it!):

![AWS Certified - Miguel Rincon](/img/posts/aws-certified-architect-miguel.png)

This certification requires to review a lot of material, at this point I am no an absolute AWS expert by I can get around setting up a virtual network and running my own infrastructure on AWS.

The certification lasts 2 years, after which I will have to be recertified (AWS is changing very very fast).
