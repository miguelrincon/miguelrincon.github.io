Thanks to the great courses by ["A Cloud Guru"](https://acloud.guru/) I am now certified as AWS Certified Solutions Architect (Associate):

![AWS Certified - Miguel Rincon](/img/posts/aws-certified-architect-miguel.png)

This certification requires to review a lot of material, multiple AWS products, as well as live practice in the AWS environment. I built my AWS expertise, so now I can get around setting up a virtual network and running my own infrastructure on AWS for a few of my personal projects.

The certification lasts 2 years, after which I will have to be re-certified, as AWS offering is changing very fast.
