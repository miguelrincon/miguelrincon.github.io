title: I joined GitLab as Senior Frontend Engineer!

I joined GitLab last Monday as member of the newly formed Monitor APM group. I have spent the last week doing onboarding and meeting awesome people in the GitLab team from many locations.

I also added myself to the GitLab team page:

The [APM group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#apm-group) is responsible for providing the tools required to enable monitoring of GitLab instances, providing solutions for reporting of metrics, logging, and tracing.
