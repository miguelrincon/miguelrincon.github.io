Implementing **User Interfaces** using Reactive Programming? I found these resources useful to understand and implement UI using them.

- [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/intro.html
): A library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.
- [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/): Reactive Extensions Library for JavaScript, part of the ReactiveX  family of libraries.
- [RxJS Marbles](https://rxmarbles.com/): Interactive diagrams of `Rx Observables`. *A learning tool for Stream/Observable manipulation.*
- [rxdart Observable](https://pub.dartlang.org/documentation/rxdart/latest/rx/Observable-class.html): A wrapper class that extends Stream. It combines all the `Streams` and `StreamTransformers` contained in this library into a fluent api. *Is the most important class in RxDart, which contains most of its functionality.*

## An example implementation

A simple implementation of a login form which uses RxDart.
