*Full-stack developer and software team lead in Shanghai, China.*

### Engineer

I build and architect client-side web applications.

JavaScript is my best programming language, with 7+ years of experience, and I have created over 6 large projects using [JS frameworks](/2018-02-15-frontend-frameworks-comparison/). I use HTML 5, SASS+CSS, NodeJS and Git daily. I automate my tests with Jest, Jasmine, Selenium, and Protractor.

I have full-stack expertise as well, other languages I use are Python, Java, and PHP (more than 10 Drupal CMS projects).

### Best Practices Advocate

I drive best practices implementation, with [Agile](/2019-05-10-non-agile-agile/) and SCRUM, manual (and automated) code reviews, pushing TDD, integration and end-to-end tests. I have a DevOps mindset and always have [Continuous Delivery](/pages/ci-cd-checklist/) as an objective.

I lead Agile project teams, implement and improve CI/CD pipelines in software projects in which I take part. I also coach and help team members be more effective.

I am a Gitlab user and fanboy, I set up jobs using Jenkins and Gitlab CI, and run quality assurance initiatives.

### Tech Lead

I have led teams, I have **hired, coached and mentored** my team, I have worked with people from many countries, in-person and remotely. I often end up involved in figuring out difficult technical issues as well as handling team and organization-related topics.

### Extra credit

Education as engineers should be ongoing, so I continue to study and improve my skills in my spare time:

- Experimented with Vue.js & ECharts to show the [pollution levels in Shanghai](/pages/pollution-chart/index.html).
