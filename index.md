My name is Miguel, I am from Colombia. I work and live in Shanghai, China.

### Work stuff

During my career I have been lucky to work with amazing technologies (and with amazing people).

I could be described as a person with "T-shaped" skills: about half of my career, I have been deeply involved in front-end development, and the other half in more general topics such as Agile, digital marketing, project management, automation & DevOps, application architecture, and more recently, management.

I started coding and suffering web development on IE6 and now I am here.

Companies and bosses seem to like me, I have been rehired twice (in 2 different companies), so my resume reads like a poem, it rhymes.

### Still asking about work?

Some hard-skills, in somewhat particular order:

JavaScript, AngularJS, HMTL, Git, SASS & SCCS, Jasmine, Jenkins, Gitlab, SonarQube,  Scrum, Agile, Code Quality, Linux, Testing Coverage, Jasmine, Protractor, SalesForce, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, PHP, Drupal, Product Design.

Soft-skills would be harder to list. I have led teams, I have hired people, coached and mentored them, I have worked with people from many countries, in person and remotely. I often end up involved in figuring out difficult technical issues as well as handling team and organization related topics.

### Let's talk about something else...

Sure! Ask me about... Colombia, diving, China, bowling, bad guitar playing, fasting, frugality, Improv theater, cryptocurrencies and of course, computer stuff.
