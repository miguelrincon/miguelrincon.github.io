Full-stack developer and software team leader in Shanghai, China.

### My work

My work as a software engineer as has focused on [Front-End](/2018-02-15-frontend-frameworks-comparison/) web development *and* I have [Full Stack Development](/2019-01-20-fullstack-developer-nanodegree/) expertise as well.

I have worked in Agile Project management, Digital Marketing, Automation & CI, [DevOps in AWS](/2018-03-06-amazon-certified/), application architecture, and more recently, team management. I champion Continuous Delivery ([CI/CD](/pages/ci-cd-checklist/)) in all projects in which I take part.

### Team leader

I have led teams, I have **hired** people, **coached and mentored** them, I have worked with people from many countries, in-person and remotely. I often end up involved in figuring out difficult technical issues as well as handling team and organization-related topics.

This wouldn't have been possible without the help of some great colleagues... like my friend Toni, working as [product manager](https://tonischmidt.me/).

### Specifics about tech?

Listing in a somewhat particular order:

**JavaScript**, AngularJS, NodeJS, Python, Scrum, **Agile**, Git, SASS & SCCS, Jasmine, Jenkins, Gitlab, SonarQube, Code Quality, Linux, Testing Automation, Jasmine, Protractor, SalesForce, Continuous Integration, **Continuous Delivery**, PHP, Drupal, Product Design.

### Extra credit

Education as engineers should be ongoing, I continue to study in my spare time:

- I completed Udacity's [Full-stack developer nanodegree](http://localhost:4000/2019-01-20-fullstack-developer-nanodegree/) to build a Python application from the ground up.
- Experimented with VueJS & ECharts to show the [pollution levels in Shanghai](/pages/pollution-chart/index.html).
- See other [online courses I am enrolled in](https://www.udemy.com/user/miguel-rincon-4/).

### Let's talk about something else...

Sure! Ask me about... Colombia, diving, China, bowling, bad guitar playing, fasting, frugality, Improv theater, cryptocurrencies and of course, computer stuff.
