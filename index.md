Full stack developer and software team leader in Shanghai, China.

### My work

During my career, I have been lucky to work with amazing technologies, and with amazing people.

My work as a software engineer as has focused on [Front-End](/2018-02-15-frontend-frameworks-comparison/) web development *and* I have [Full Stack Development](/2019-01-20-fullstack-developer-nanodegree/) expertise as well.

I have worked in Agile Project management, Digital Marketing, Automation & CI, [DevOps in AWS](/2018-03-06-amazon-certified/), application architecture, and more recently, team management. I champion Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) in all projects in which I take part.
