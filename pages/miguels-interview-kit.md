title: Miguel's Interview Kit

I think as a software developers, we are more capable of building **new technologies** than building **new teams**, and hiring in tech is a difficult task to get right. We all have a responsibility to find better ways to communicate with each other about our capabilities.

As an engineer being interviewed or team leader making the interview, we should be well prepared to understand each other's skills. During recruitment, **we spend only a few hours together**, so we should make the most of them.

I am building up this *kit* to help my fellow engineers, fellow technical managers and myself.
