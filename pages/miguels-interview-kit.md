title: Miguel's Interview Kit
---

Software Engineering as a profession is new and immature. As a community, we are more capable of building **new tools** than building **new teams**. We all have a responsibility to find better ways to communicate with each other about our capabilities.

As an engineer being interviewed or team leader making the interview, we should be well prepared to understand each other's skills. During recruitment, **we spend only a few hours together**, so we should make the most of them.

I am building up this *kit* to help my fellow engineers and myself to have better interview experience.
